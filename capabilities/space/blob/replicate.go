// Replicate is a capability that allows an agent to replicate a Blob into a
// space identified by did:key in the `with` field.
//
// A Replicate capability may only be invoked after a `blob/accept` receipt has
// been receieved, indicating the source node has successfully received the blob.
// Each Replicate task MUST target a different node, and they MUST NOT target
// the original upload target.
//
// The Replicate task receipt includes async tasks for `blob/replica/allocate`
// and `blob/replica/transfer`. Successful completion of the
// `blob/replica/transfer` task indicates the replication target has transferred
// and stored the blob. The number of `blob/replica/allocate` and
// `blob/replica/transfer tasks corresponds directly to number of replicas
// requested.
